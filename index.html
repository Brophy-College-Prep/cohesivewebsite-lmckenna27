Schools play a crucial role in addressing these issues, not only by educating the next generation of environmental leaders but also by serving as models of sustainable practices in their communities. By tracking and improving sustainability metrics, schools can reduce their carbon footprint, lower operational costs, and provide hands-on learning opportunities that align with real-world environmental challenges.</p>

            <h2>🗑️ Waste Reduction & Recycling</h2>
            <p>Effective waste management is one of the most visible and impactful sustainability initiatives a school can implement. Our platform helps you track recycling rates, monitor composting programs, and reduce single-use plastics throughout your campus. By implementing comprehensive waste audits and setting reduction targets, schools can divert thousands of pounds of waste from landfills each year while teaching students valuable lessons about consumption and resource management.</p>

            <h2>⚡ Energy Conservation</h2>
            <p>Schools are significant energy consumers, with lighting, heating, cooling, and technology accounting for substantial operational costs and carbon emissions. Through our energy tracking tools, schools can monitor electricity usage in real-time, identify inefficiencies, and implement solutions such as LED lighting upgrades, smart thermostats, and renewable energy installations. Many schools have reduced their energy consumption by 20-40% through systematic monitoring and behavioral changes, resulting in both environmental benefits and significant cost savings.</p>

            <h2>💧 Water Conservation</h2>
            <p>Water is a precious resource, and schools have numerous opportunities to reduce consumption through fixture upgrades, leak detection, and landscape management. Our water tracking module helps identify usage patterns, detect anomalies that may indicate leaks, and measure the impact of conservation efforts. From installing low-flow faucets to creating drought-resistant landscaping, schools can reduce water usage while educating students about this critical environmental issue.</p>

            <h2>🌳 Green Spaces & Biodiversity</h2>
            <p>Transforming school grounds into vibrant ecosystems provides numerous benefits, from improving air quality to creating outdoor learning laboratories. Track the development of school gardens, native plant installations, pollinator habitats, and tree planting initiatives. These projects not only enhance biodiversity but also provide hands-on educational opportunities that connect students with nature and reinforce lessons about ecology, food systems, and environmental stewardship.</p>
